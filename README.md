# esp32_IR_sensor - Heat Seeking Drone Project

This repository holds the arduino code that is loaded onto the ESP32 board to get the IR data from the sensor and send it over wifi to a local port.

The majority of this code was provided by Boston Electronics upon purchasing the sensor and application board from them. Out of the box, the code streamed data over wifi to a GUI they provide. The protocol for streaming data was too fast and unreliable for our use case in this project.
